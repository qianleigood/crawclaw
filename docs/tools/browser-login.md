# Browser login + X/Twitter posting

## Manual login (recommended)

When a site requires login, **sign in manually** in the **host** browser profile (the crawclaw browser).

Do **not** give the model your credentials. Automated logins often trigger anti‑bot defenses and can lock the account.

Back to the main browser docs: [Browser](/tools/browser).

## Which Chrome profile is used?

CrawClaw controls a **dedicated Chrome profile** (named `crawclaw`, orange‑tinted UI). This is separate from your daily browser profile.

For agent browser tool calls:

- Default choice: the agent should use its isolated `crawclaw` browser.
- Use `profile="user"` only when existing logged-in sessions matter and the user is at the computer to click/approve any attach prompt.
- If you have multiple user-browser profiles, specify the profile explicitly instead of guessing.

Two easy ways to access it:

1. **Ask the agent to open the browser** and then log in yourself.
2. **Call the browser tool directly**:

```json
{ "action": "open", "profile": "crawclaw", "url": "https://x.com" }
```

If you have multiple profiles, pass the tool's `profile` argument explicitly
(the default is `crawclaw`).

## X/Twitter: recommended flow

- **Read/search/threads:** use the **host** browser (manual login).
- **Post updates:** use the **host** browser (manual login).

## Sandboxing + host browser access

Sandboxed browser sessions are **more likely** to trigger bot detection. For X/Twitter (and other strict sites), prefer the **host** browser.

If the agent is sandboxed, the browser tool defaults to the sandbox. To allow host control:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      sandbox: {
        mode: "non-main",
        browser: {
          allowHostControl: true,
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Then target the host browser:

```json
{
  "action": "open",
  "target": "host",
  "profile": "crawclaw",
  "url": "https://x.com"
}
```

Or disable sandboxing for the agent that posts updates.
