# Channels and routing

CrawClaw routes replies **back to the channel where a message came from**. The
model does not choose a channel; routing is deterministic and controlled by the
host configuration.

## Key terms

- **Channel**: the Rust-native channel id. Internal session channels are not configurable outbound channels.
- **AccountId**: per‑channel account instance (when supported).
- Optional channel default account: `channels.<channel>.defaultAccount` chooses
  which account is used when an outbound path does not specify `accountId`.
  - In multi-account setups, set an explicit default (`defaultAccount` or `accounts.default`) when two or more accounts are configured. Without it, fallback routing may pick the first normalized account ID.
- **AgentId**: an isolated workspace + session store (“brain”).
- **SessionKey**: the bucket key used to store context and control concurrency.

## Session key shapes (examples)

Direct messages collapse to the agent’s **main** session:

- `agent:<agentId>:<mainKey>` (default: `agent:main:main`)

Groups and channels remain isolated per channel:

- Groups: `agent:<agentId>:<channel>:group:<id>`
- Channels/rooms: `agent:<agentId>:<channel>:channel:<id>`

Example:

- `agent:main:<channel>:group:<id>`

## Main DM route pinning

When `session.dmScope` is `main`, direct messages may share one main session.
To prevent the session’s `lastRoute` from being overwritten by non-owner DMs,
CrawClaw infers a pinned owner from `allowFrom` when all of these are true:

- `allowFrom` has exactly one non-wildcard entry.
- The entry can be normalized to a concrete sender ID for that channel.
- The inbound DM sender does not match that pinned owner.

In that mismatch case, CrawClaw still records inbound session metadata, but it
skips updating the main session `lastRoute`.

## Routing rules (how an agent is chosen)

Routing picks **one agent** for each inbound message:

1. **Exact peer match** (`bindings` with `peer.kind` + `peer.id`).
2. **Parent peer match** (thread inheritance).
3. **Account match** (`accountId` on the channel).
4. **Channel match** (any account on that channel, `accountId: "*"`).
5. **Default agent** (`agents.list[].default`, else first list entry, fallback to `main`).

When a binding includes multiple match fields, all provided fields must match
for that binding to apply.

The matched agent determines which workspace and session store are used.

## Config overview

- `agents.list`: named agent definitions (workspace, model, etc.).
- `bindings`: map inbound channels/accounts/peers to agents.

Example:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    list: [{ id: "support", name: "Support", workspace: "~/.crawclaw/workspace-support" }],
  },
  bindings: [
    {
      match: { channel: "internal", peer: { kind: "group", id: "group-123" } },
      agentId: "support",
    },
  ],
}
```

## Session storage

Session stores live under the state directory (default `~/.crawclaw`):

- `~/.crawclaw/agents/<agentId>/sessions/sessions.json`
- JSONL transcripts live alongside the store

You can override the store path via `session.store` and `{agentId}` templating.

Gateway and ACP session discovery also scans disk-backed agent stores under the
default `agents/` root and under templated `session.store` roots. Discovered
stores must stay inside that resolved agent root and use a regular
`sessions.json` file. Symlinks and out-of-root paths are ignored.

## Reply context

Inbound replies include:

- `ReplyToId`, `ReplyToBody`, and `ReplyToSender` when available.
- Quoted context is appended to `Body` as a `[Replying to ...]` block.

This is consistent across channels.
